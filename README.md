As a lead product engineer at Hack4Impact I collaborated with the design team to prototype an interactive timeline of events using Figma. I then modeled object-oriented programming solutions to validate the efficiency of using React vs. Vue.

An example of these solutions is a timeline component built in React to highlight the many events of a tragic example of police brutality.
